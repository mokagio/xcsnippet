# xcsnippet

A simple **and very WIP** CLI to manage Xcode snippets.

## Current Status

**xcsnippet** _wants_ to be a smart way to handle snippets across multiple instances of Xcode.

At the moment xcsnippet is nothing more than a script that allows you to:

* Rename and edit the metadata of the snippets you already have.
* Copy snippets from a folder to the default Xcode location.

I have other things in my todo list right now more useful to me than xcsnippet,
so the development is gonna stop for a while.

Some idea I have on how to make the project go forward are:

* Copy snippets fro a git repo
* Better CLI
* Ditch Ruby and move to Go
